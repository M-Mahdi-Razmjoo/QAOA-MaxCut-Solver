# QAOA-MaxCut-Solver

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) to solve the MaxCut problem using Qiskit. The MaxCut problem is a fundamental combinatorial optimization problem where the objective is to partition the vertices of a graph into two sets such that the number of edges between the sets is maximized.

## Features
- Implementation of the QAOA algorithm for MaxCut.
- Simulation of quantum circuits using Qiskit Aer.
- Optimization of parameters to maximize the cut.
- Visualization of quantum circuits and results.
